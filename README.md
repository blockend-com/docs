## :ocean:Liquidity Exchange (LEX)

LEX solves the inefficiencies of traditional intent-based protocols by offering a scalable, cost-effective, and infrastructure-light solution for omnichain liquidity. Built on the **Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)**, LEX can power seamless liquidity movement for **an inevitable future of a million chains**.\
\
With the introduction of **Intents 2.0**, LEX eliminates the need for complex infrastructure, significantly **reducing costs for users, solvers, and validators**. Its design **scales effortlessly to the latest chains**, including those with unique architectures or unconventional technical stacks, ensuring compatibility without compromise.

## Scale To Any Chain Without Infrastructure Bottlenecks

* **Infrastructure-Light Design**: Eliminates the need for smart contracts on source and destination chains and cross-chain messaging layers. This significantly reduces time-to-market and removes scaling bottlenecks when integrating new chains.
* **Support for Non-Standard Chains**: Seamlessly integrates chains with unique architectures or tech stacks, including EVM, Non-EVM, Modular, or unconventional protocols, ensuring compatibility without compromising efficiency.
* **Efficient Operations for Solvers and Validators**: The simplified design minimizes operational overhead, lowering costs and enabling streamlined processes for all participants.

### Low Cost Transactions, Faster and Capital Efficient Settlements

* **Unified Execution:** LEX consolidates all critical components of intent bridges including Escrow, Fulfillment, Validation, and Settlement into a single, decentralized ledger built on the SVM, optimized for seamless liquidity movement across chains.
* **Unparalleled Efficiency:** Solver and validator interactions occur directly on the LEX chain, enabling unprecedented speed and cost efficiency throughout the intent protocol lifecycle.
* **Enhanced Capital Utilization:** Faster settlements allow liquidity to be rapidly reused, maximizing solver capital efficiency while minimizing delays.
