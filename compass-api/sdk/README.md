# SDK

Compass SDK is a powerful cross-chain transaction SDK that provides a unified liquidity layer by aggregating multiple liquidity sources across blockchain networks. It seamlessly integrates DEXs (Decentralised Exchanges), Cross-chain Bridges, RFQ (Request for Quote) systems, and Intent Protocols into a single, reliable interface. \
\
This enables developers to easily implement cross-chain token swaps, transfers, and complex DeFi operations across EVM chains, Solana, and Cosmos ecosystems.
