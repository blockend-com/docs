## Compass Widget Lite: A Streamlined Solution for Focused Use Cases

### Enable users to get the desired token seamlessly, directly on your DApp, with no distractions.

Widget Lite is designed to simplify core use cases, such as NFT checkouts or deposits into LP pools, by focusing on a clean, lightweight interface. It removes unnecessary features, providing users with a single recommended route tailored to the DAppâ€™s customization preferences. This allows users to connect their wallet, view their balances, select the token they have, and specify the amount to transfer or deposit, all seamlessly handled with minimal effort.

With its lightweight design and seamless end-to-end execution, WidgetLite is perfect for scenarios requiring simplicity, speed, and precision.

### _**Note: WidgetLite is currently under active development and is expected to launch in a few weeks, bringing this streamlined solution to life.**_
