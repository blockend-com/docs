# ♾️ LEX OLD

Lex is Intents 2.0, removing the limitations that hold back legacy and intent-based bridges. It enables faster, cheaper, and truly scalable cross-chain liquidity, unlocking the full potential of Web3.\

LEX Protocol (In Developement

_While building Compass, we realized that aggregating and connecting existing liquidity is a crucial foundation, but current solutions cannot scale for a future with a thousand chains._

_This inspired us to reimagine the base infrastructure for cross-chain liquidity and build Lex._

### **Why a New Protocol?**

Intent-based protocols solve the user experience problem by letting users state, ‘I have X, I want Y,’ and instantly receive assets on another chain.

However they still rely on legacy infrastructure like, cross-chain messaging, smart contracts on each chain and traditional bridging mechanisms behind the scenes for core components. This reliance on legacy infrastructure lead to high fees, locked capital, limited scalability, and slower settlements.

### **LEX: Intents 2.0**

Lex redefines intent-based bridging by moving all core processes—escrow, fulfillment, validation, and settlement—to a single, high-speed SVM chain. No more per-chain smart contracts or cross-chain messaging overhead, which dramatically lowers costs, boosts speed, and reduces complexity.

### **Why Is LEX Better?**

• **Reduced Infrastructure:** Eliminates the need for Smart Contracts on each chain plus less infrastructure costs for validators and solvers.

• **Lower Fees:** Consolidating everything on one chain slashes transaction, validation and settlements costs, making even small transfers feasible.

• **Instant Scalability:** Adding a new chain is as simple as a solver providing liquidity—no heavy setup required.

• **Faster Settlement:** Near-instant finalization on the SVM chain frees up solver liquidity quickly, driving higher capital efficiency.

#### Lex rethinks intent-based bridging in a single, high-speed layer—enabling near-instant, cost-effective transfers that can quickly scale to any chain.

#### LEX is an Omnichain liquidity protocol designed to enable seamless liquidity movement across millions of chains: an inevitable future by reinventing Intent based bridges and introducing intents 2.0 which eliminates the need for complex infrastructure and reduces cost for validators and solvers by orders of magnitude.

### • **Minimized Infrastructure Overhead For Validators & Solvers:**&#x20;

Eliminates the need for Smart Contracts on each chain plus less infrastructure costs for validators and solvers.

### • Lower Costs Enable High Frequency Low Value Transactions Possible

Consolidating everything on one chain slashes transaction, validation and settlements costs, making even small transfers feasible.

### • **Infinite Scalability Even With Never Unique Architecture chains:**&#x20;

Adding a new chain is as simple as a solver providing liquidity—no heavy setup required.

### • **Faster Settlements Improve Capital Efficiency & Utilisation:**&#x20;

Near-instant finalization on the SVM chain frees up solver liquidity quickly, driving higher capital efficiency.

LEX is an omnichain intent protocol designed to enable seamless liquidity movement across millions of chains: an inevitable future.

By reimagining cross-chain liquidity movement, LEX consolidates all core processes of current intent protocols—escrow, fulfillment, validation, and settlement—into a single high-speed SVM chain. \
It eliminates the need for smart contracts on every chain and cross-chain messaging overhead, dramatically reducing costs, increasing speed, and simplifying integration with new chains.\
\
LEX consolidates all core components of Intent Bridges including Escrow, Fulfillment, Validation, and Settlement, into a single, high-speed SVM chain, purpose-built for fast, cost-effective liquidity movement across chains.

\
All solver and validator interactions with the core components occur directly on the LEX chain, delivering unprecedented speed and significantly reducing costs throughout the intent protocol lifecycle. This enables faster settlements, maximizes solver capital efficiency, and ensures liquidity is rapidly reusable.

### Why?

By reimagining intent-based bridges and introducing **Intents 2.0**, LEX eliminates the need for complex infrastructure, dramatically reducing costs and simplifying processes for solvers and validators.
