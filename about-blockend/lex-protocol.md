### The Cross-Chain Challenge

Aggregators like Compass have transformed how users move assets across chains, making complex transfers feel seamless with a single interface. Yet even the most sophisticated aggregation can't overcome the fundamental limitations of today's bridging infrastructure. While Compass can discover routes that other aggregators miss, it's still constrained by bridges that support only the most popular assets, require multiple validation layers, and rely on slow cross-chain messaging.

This means even optimal routes often involve multiple steps and intermediaries, with each hop accumulating its own gas fees, bridge fees, and validator costs. What should be a simple transfer becomes prohibitively expensive, especially for smaller transactions where fees can exceed the transfer amount itself. The problem extends far beyond the top 10-15 chains and tokens, there's massive user demand across hundreds of emerging chains and tokens that current bridge infrastructure simply cannot serve efficiently. With an ecosystem already spanning 300+ chains and potentially growing to thousands, these infrastructure limitations aren't just inconvenient they're becoming a critical bottleneck for cross-chain liquidity.

### **The Rise of Intent-Based Bridges**

Intent-based bridges revolutionize cross-chain transactions by focusing on a simple principle: users say what they want, and get it within seconds. Instead of navigating complex technical steps, users express straightforward intents like "I have DAI on Base and want BONK on Solana."

Behind the scenes, specialized participants called solvers compete to fulfill these intents. The key innovation? Solvers front their own liquidity on destination chains. Rather than waiting for a long bridging process or complex multi-step transactions with multiple gas fees, users receive their desired tokens almost immediately because solvers front the liquidity and optimize execution across available liquidity sources – including DEXs, bridges, and other venues.

Intent-based bridging transforms complex cross-chain transactions into a seamless two-phase process that separates user experience from solver settlement.

**Phase 1: User Intent Flow:**\
The user expresses intent, solvers compete, and the winning solver delivers the desired tokens to the user instantly on the destination chain.

1. **Intent Expression**\
   The user submits their intent via a simple interface, triggering an auction where solvers compete to offer the best terms.
2. **Escrow**\
   The user’s funds are escrowed in a smart contract on the source chain, involving smart contract interactions and event monitoring by validators to ensure proper fund locking.
3. **Fulfillment**\
   The winning solver fulfills the user’s request by delivering the desired asset on the destination chain.

**Phase 2: Solver Settlement Flow:**

After fulfillment, the solver’s fronted liquidity is repaid through a settlement process handled by the intent protocol.

4. **Submit Claim**\
   The solver submits a claim with proof of the fulfilled intent to the protocol’s smart contract on the destination chain.
5. **Validation**\
   Validators verify the relevant events on both the source and destination chains, utilizing cross-chain messaging, smart contract interactions, and forming consensus.
6. **Reimbursement**\
   &#x20;After successful validation and consensus, a signature verifying the intent’s completion is posted to the protocol’s smart contract, and the solver is reimbursed from the locked funds on the source chain.

This two-phase design achieves a critical goal: users get instant results while the system maintains rigorous security through thorough settlement procedures. The complexity of cross-chain messaging, validator consensus, and settlement logistics remains invisible to users, who experience only the seamless front-end transaction.

### **The Settlement Bottleneck**

While intent-based bridges have streamlined the user experience, their back-end settlement process still relies on legacy bridge infrastructure. Though critical for ensuring secure and accurate transactions, this process creates significant bottlenecks that hinder scalability, drive up costs, and introduce operational inefficiencies.

**Three main bottlenecks in the settlement process:**

1. :office: **Infrastructure Overhead**\
   Protocols must deploy and audit smart contracts for every supported chain, while validators manage full nodes, event monitoring, cross-chain messaging, and contract interactions. Since protocols rely on smart contracts, they cannot support chains without such capabilities, like Bitcoin, or those with different virtual machine architectures. These demands increase complexity and limit scaling to more chains.
2. :moneybag: **High Costs**\
   Settlement requires frequent smart contract calls across multiple chains, including deposits, fill events, validation, and claims, which lead to high gas fees. Cross-chain messaging and validator infrastructure further increase costs, especially on chains with expensive gas fees. These expenses reduce solver and validator margins and are ultimately passed on to the user, ultimately increasing end user fees.
3. :unlock:**Locked Liquidity**\
   Settlement delays caused by multi-step validation, cross-chain messaging, and challenge periods lock solver liquidity. Solvers, who operate on thin margins and rely on high transaction frequency, face reduced capital efficiency due to these delays. Locked funds limit their ability to handle new transactions, making it harder to expand liquidity to additional chains and impacting overall profitability.

_**For intent-based bridges to fully replace traditional bridges and unlock their potential, these bottlenecks must be addressed.**_

### Introducing Intents 2.0

LEX takes the core components of intent protocols such as escrow, fulfillment, validation, and settlement—and moves all of them to a purpose-built SVM chain on Solana. This chain is optimized for speed and cost, tailored specifically to the intent protocol lifecycle. While the core components remain the same, LEX eliminates the need for smart contracts on every supported chain and reduces dependency on legacy infrastructure like cross-chain messaging. By redefining who does what, how it happens, and where these processes are executed, LEX streamlines operations, lowers costs, and introduces the next evolution: Intents 2.0.

#### _Three Key Changes in LEX: From Intent 1.0 to Intent 2.0_

1. **Streamlined Solver and Validator Operations on a Single Chain**\
   All solver and validator-related operations and actions are consolidated onto a single, dedicated, fast, and cost-effective SVM chain. This reduces complexity and significantly lowers costs.
2. **Elimination of Smart Contracts on Source and Destination Chains**\
   By removing smart contracts from both source and destination chains, LEX simplifies operations for users and solvers. Asset transfers are reduced to simple token transactions, improving scalability and minimizing overhead.
3. **Infrastructure-Free Validators with Economic Incentives**\
   LEX removes the need for validators to maintain complex infrastructure across multiple chains. A robust reward and slashing mechanism ensures security and accuracy, making the system both scalable and secure.\\

\
LEX streamlines the core components of escrow, fulfillment, validation, and settlement by implementing these three key changes. The following sections break down each stage in detail to highlight the specific innovations driving these improvements.

### Escrow: Secure Collateral Without Source Chain Smart Contracts

Instead of users locking funds in source chain smart contracts, LEX requires winning solvers to escrow collateral on the SVM chain. This seemingly simple change has profound implications. Users now make basic token transfers directly to solver addresses a transaction that costs dramatically less in gas than smart contract interactions, especially on high-fee chains like Ethereum. The solver’s escrowed collateral on the SVM chain provides bulletproof security without the overhead of cross-chain smart contracts.

Consider how this improves upon traditional systems: In current intent protocols, users must interact with smart contracts that need deployment, auditing, and maintenance on every supported chain. Each interaction involves multiple transaction layers: first to approve tokens, then to deposit them, each incurring gas costs. LEX reduces this to a single standard token transfer while maintaining equivalent security through solver collateral.

### **Fulfillment: Reducing Infrastructure by Focusing on Intent Completion**

The end goal of an intent protocol is to ensure that the user’s intent is fulfilled and that the solver is appropriately compensated. If this critical aspect can be completed and verified, then there is no need for extensive infrastructure that monitors every specific event, including the source chain deposit.

Solvers already take on finality risk in traditional protocols, they routinely fulfill intents before source chain transactions fully finalize, occasionally losing funds to block reorganizations. Since solvers have already priced in and accepted this risk, LEX eliminates the need for costly cross-chain validation infrastructure. By focusing on verifying the fulfillment of the user’s intent on the destination chain, the system becomes far more efficient.

However, there may be instances where the source chain transaction needs to be validated, such as when the intent is canceled by the user, the source transaction fails, or other issues arise. In such cases, the escrow of the solver must be released. LEX accommodates these scenarios by enabling validators to verify source chain transactions when required, but without the need for full-scale infrastructure. These mechanisms ensure that the system remains robust while avoiding unnecessary overhead.

### **Validation: Flexible and Incentivized Verification for Scalability**

The current infrastructure requirements maintaining nodes, monitoring smart contracts, and verifying cross-chain events add complexity without providing meaningful benefits to solvers and validators. The end goal of validators in LEX is to ensure that the user’s intent is fulfilled, verified, and that solvers are repaid for their efforts on time.

The broader objective of the protocol is to capture a user’s intent, find the best possible execution path for solver liquidity, and ensure that the intent is fulfilled. How this happens doesn’t need to be rigid or overly complex, as long as the process is verified by actors with skin in the game and proven on-chain. With this approach, LEX avoids dictating specific infrastructure requirements, offering validators flexibility in how they verify transactions.

The protocol’s robust reward and slashing mechanism ensures security: validators stake assets as skin in the game, incentivizing them to maintain perfect accuracy regardless of their chosen verification approach. When a validator submits a signature confirming a transaction’s validity, it carries weight because their staked assets back that claim. Incorrect validations result in penalties, creating strong economic pressure for validators to develop reliable verification systems.

### **Settlement: Fast, Cost-Effective Finalization on the SVM Chain**

The settlement process showcases even more dramatic efficiency gains. Validators only need to monitor SVM chain events in real-time and run a full node for the SVM chain. They receive transaction data for destination chain verification, streamlining their operations. This consolidation eliminates the need for validators to interact with or track dozens of different smart contracts and run nodes for all other chains.

Consensus becomes remarkably efficient because validators do not need to collaborate to reach consensus in real-time. Instead, they individually verify transactions and submit their signatures to the SVM chain smart contract. Once a sufficient majority (typically 15 out of 20 validators) confirms a transaction, the solver’s escrowed funds are automatically released minus protocol fees. The entire process occurs on the high-performance SVM chain, where 50-millisecond block times enable near-instant settlement.

This architecture delivers unprecedented improvements in capital efficiency. Traditional intent protocols often lock solver funds for 24-48 hours during settlement. Even “optimistic” protocols typically impose 4-hour challenge periods. LEX’s streamlined settlement completes in minutes—up to 100 times faster than traditional systems. This speed allows solvers to reuse capital more frequently, handling higher transaction volumes with less locked collateral.

#### Bottom Line

Looking at the end-to-end process, LEX's innovations multiply: User intents are fulfilled faster through direct transfers. Settlement happens almost immediately on the optimized SVM chain. Validation is streamlined yet secure through economic incentives. And the entire system scales effortlessly to new chains without additional infrastructure overhead. Each component has been carefully redesigned to maximize efficiency while maintaining security, creating a protocol that's both more performant and more practical than traditional alternatives.
