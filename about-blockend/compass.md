# üß≠ Compass&#x20;

When a user visits a new dApp, their first thought is : **‚ÄúWhich token do I need, and on which chain, to use this dApp?‚Äù**

This forces them into a complex journey of researching, swapping, and transferring assets across platforms **often resulting in drop-offs and lost revenue for the dApp**.

If, by some miracle, a dev decides to tackle this friction and improve the user experience (a rarity among Web3 devs), they face the daunting task of:

* Integrating a colossal number of chains, wallets, providers, and liquidity sources.
* Deciphering wildly different mechanisms and tech across platforms because, well, Web3.
* Undertaking a journey so complex it can take years and demand significant resources.

#### _There has to be a better way! (_ :shark: _Shark Tank Style)_
